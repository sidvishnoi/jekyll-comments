## Setup

#### [Video Tutorial - Static Comments for your Jekyll Website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdHL4h4Wvuk) 
(*sorry for lag in video, will create new one and reupload soon*)

Install following python modules, if you don't have them

``` bash
# Terminal markdown viewer https://github.com/axiros/terminal_markdown_viewer
$ pip install mdv

# PyYaml
$ pip install pyyaml
```

**Obtain `apiUrl`** *Create a database on Google Sheets* ;)

1. Login to your Google Account.
2. Copy [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1naZA_ytl7CBW8ytE5MPWIEi3L8hzJhH0y1EbnyZ1Dag/copy).
3. Configure `Code.gs`. Edit the `deletekey` (`string` *recommended that key should be long and random, like some md5 hash*). Choose whether you want the API profanity filter or not (`true/false`)
4. In Apps Script, `Publish > Deploy as web app` at following settings:

```
Project version: New
Execute the app as: Me
Who has access to the app: Anyone, even anonymous
```

Give the permissions when prompted and copy the URL given which looks like **apiUrl** = `https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyTwxtrSxu...g5Guoj5KiKsPMyh4aXQ6c_/exec`


**Obtain a Google Authentication client ID**

Refer to this article by Google : [https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project)

Now you have `YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com`

Create a new project using `git clone  project_name`, configure files as defined below. Obtain API URL and ClientID as explained below. You're set.

Alternatively, follow these steps:

Copy `jekyll-comments/` and all its contents to your project folder. Add `jekyll-comments/` to exclusions in your Jekyll config and gitignore \

``` yml
# _config.yml
exclude: ['jekyll-comments/']

# .gitignore
jekyll-comments/
```

* Copy `jekyll-comments/comments.html` to your project's `_includes/comments.html` folder.
* Copy `jekyll-comments/comments.sass` to `assets/css/comments.sass`.
* Copy `jekyll-comments/comments.js` to `assets/js/comments.js`.
* Add following line between `<head> ... </head>` of each of your page: 

``` liquid
<meta name="google-signin-client_id" content="{{site['jekyll-comments']['client_id']}}">
```

Include `comments.html` in your posts as:

``` liquid
{% unless page.comments == "nope" %}
<div id="comment-section" class="comment-section">
	{% include comments.html %}
</div>
{% endunless %}
```

## Configure

Open your `_config.yml` and add the following in end:

``` yml
jekyll-comments:
  apiUrl: ""
  # [REQUIRED] the url you received from Google Apps Script step, e.g.
  # "apiUrl": "https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyTwxtrSxu...g5Guoj5KiKsPMyh4aXQ6c_/exec"
  commentsDir: ""
  # this is where are comments are saved, 
  # default: "_data/comments/"
  logFile: ""
  # this file will keep a list of files in which comments are updated, useful in partial builds. 
  # default: "jekyll-comments/comments.log"
  saveAsmd5: False
  # if True, the email ids in _data/comments/*.yml are saved as md5 hashes, useful if you make your _data/comments/*.yml public
  # otherwise emails are stored as it is
  # default: False
  client_id: ""
  # client ID obtained from Google Sign In API
  # YOUR_CLIENT_ID.apps.googleusercontent.com
  sort: "newest_first"
  # comment sorting: "newest_first" or "oldest_first"
```


In `jekyll-comments/comments.py`, edit the `deleteKey` in settings in `def main()`. This is the same deleteKey as in the GoogleAppsScript.

``` python
settings = {
	"deleteKey": "",
	# a key that is known only to you - this is the same key as in comments.gs file
	# allows: comment deletion, get comments, user blacklisting
	# keep it safe, don't add comments.gs and comments.py to your git repo
	# default: "123456789"
	...
}
```

If you want these settings as defaults, do not delete the keys, assign them `""`

## Usage

### Enabling comments in a post

In your post's frontmatter,

``` python
comments: "disallow" # to disallow new comments, shows pre-existing comments
comments: "nope" # to completely disable the comments on page
# write nothing to allow comments
```

### Posting a comment

Use the comment form on your built pages to post comments or replies.

### Moderating

``` bash
$ cd path/to/your/project_name/
$ python jekyll-comments/comments.py
# or, if you want to allow all comments without pressing [allow] each time
# $ python jekyll-comments/comments.py all
# now moderate comments as you wish, the comments allowed are put into respective _data/comments/*.yml files
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
# to view your comments locally
```

You can also moderate the comments from your Google spreadsheet.

To add more keywords to blacklist, append a new cell with your keyword in `profanity_blacklist` sheet.

To blacklist a user, you can use the command line interface or append a new cell with the email you want to blacklist in `user_blacklist` sheet.

If you accidentally deleted your any of your `_data/comments/*.yml` file, you can move (cut and paste, not copy) required (or all) comments from `published` sheet to `pending`. Make sure to move the comments in top of `pending` sheet (to keep comments sorted by date)

## Tips

Create an alias to update comments
```
alias jcomm='cd ~/path/to/sample-project; python jekyll-comments/comments.py'
```
